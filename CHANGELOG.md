## 2026-05-25 - Deployment failure fix

## 2026-05-25 - Video-only post result and auth redirect fix

- After a YouTube video is posted, the video page now hides the link input and post button.
- The video page now leaves only the embedded posted video visible after posting.
- Signup now passes `emailRedirectTo` using the current public site origin so confirmation emails do not default to localhost.
- README now documents the required Supabase Site URL and redirect allowlist settings.

## 2026-05-25 - Social login buttons

- Replaced generic social buttons with Connect with Google, Apple, Facebook, X, and Instagram buttons.
- Google, Apple, Facebook, and X now call Supabase OAuth with the public app redirect URL.
- Instagram now supports a configured external OAuth URL and shows a clean setup message if it is not configured.
- Added `VITE_APP_URL` and `VITE_INSTAGRAM_AUTH_URL` to generated frontend config.

## 2026-05-25 - Safer Render package

- Added root-level static files in addition to `dist/` so the package can work if a host serves the upload root.
- Added `VITE_APP_URL` and `VITE_INSTAGRAM_AUTH_URL` to `render.yaml` env var declarations.
- Normalized Render static publish path to `dist`.

## 2026-05-25 - Black screen startup guard

- Added visible loading fallback HTML so the app never opens to an empty black page.
- Made Supabase client setup defensive so invalid env values cannot crash the whole page.
- Render now happens immediately before Supabase session loading, so auth/network issues cannot block the UI.
- Supabase is retried after page load in case the CDN script loads after the main app.

## 2026-05-25 - Supabase config diagnostics

- Build now accepts both `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_URL`.
- Build now accepts `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, or `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
- Build logs now print whether Supabase URL/key and app URL were detected.
- README now explains checking `/config.js` after Render redeploy.

## 2026-05-25 - Live config banner fix

- Fixed the logged-out homepage so it no longer shows the demo-mode banner just because a visitor is not signed in.
- Added protection against placeholder Supabase values such as `your-project-ref.supabase.co`.
- Live config checks now show a cleaner message when Render is still using placeholder Supabase environment variables.

## 2026-05-25 - Supabase script load order fix

- Fixed the script order so the Supabase browser library loads before `app.js`.
- Removed the public technical warning that said `Supabase library did not load yet`.
- Added a silent retry and a cleaner account-service fallback message.

## 2026-05-25 - Supabase Project URL guard

- Added a config guard for accidentally pasted Supabase dashboard URLs.
- The app now expects `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` to use the real Project URL ending in `.supabase.co`.

## 2026-05-25 - Loading screen fix

- Changed the page so `app.js` no longer waits behind the external Supabase CDN script.
- The site UI now renders first, then retries Supabase connection in the background.
- Demo-mode banner now appears only when Supabase config is actually missing.
